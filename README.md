2. Each directory contains all the relevant design files, libraries, documentation for the project.
3. Giving a brief overview of each PCB design project.
4. I have done PCB design projects using Altium, KiCAD, Eagle, Protel, Cadence Allegro, Redac

AMD-Spartan7-KiCAD: A breakout board using Xilinx Spartan7.

FPGAs-KiCAD-Ard_RPi_BB: One PCB project having numerous FPGA vendors chipsets for evaluation to be manufactured as one board having multiple breakout boards.
